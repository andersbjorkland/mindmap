# mindmap
A simple mindmap app where you can start a new mindmap or open a previously saved. 
You can choose different shapes, color, and sizes. You can adjust their relationship to each other.
There are two different kind of relations between shapes:
  * Parent-Child: A child can only have one parent, but a parent can have multiple children (One-to-many relationship).
  * Acquaintance/Associated: An idea can have multiple acquintances. Each acquaintance can have multiple acquintances of its own (many-to-many relationship).
